# Happy-Whale-Classification

Classifying whale and dolphin images into their respective species. The species count present in the database being used for this project is 30.

Currently, most research institutions rely on time-intensive—and sometimes inaccurate—manual matching by the human eye. Thousands of hours go into manual matching, which involves staring at photos to compare one individual to another, finding matches, and identifying new individuals. Also the count of images on which we will train and validate our models is about 50k.

The goal is not only to reach a higher accuracy in terms of classification but also to understand how and why the models are classifying the species and what features are they looking into.
