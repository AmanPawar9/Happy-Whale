# Happy-Whale-Classification

Classifying whale and dolphin images into their respective species. The species count present in the database being used for this project is 30.

Currently, most research institutions rely on time-intensive—and sometimes inaccurate—manual matching by the human eye. Thousands of hours go into manual matching, which involves staring at photos to compare one individual to another, finding matches, and identifying new individuals. Also the count of images on which we will train and validate our models is about 50k.

The goal is not only to reach a higher accuracy in terms of classification but also to understand how and why the models are classifying the species and what features are they looking into.

Photo ID is a technique with history, a non-invasive tool first applied to humpback whales in the 1970s by Katona and Jurasz, who saw the persistent patterns and shapes in humpback whale tails that allowed tracking over time.

Since then the technique has been applied to many whale and dolphin species, using different body parts including tails for humpbacks and sperm whales, dorsal fins for many species of whales and dolphins, patterns on the flanks of blue and grey whales, head patterns in right whales, and even facial recognition in bottlenose dolphins.

Through study of multiple sightings of individuals over time and space, scientists can learn about migratory patterns and home ranges, model population growth or decline, and even estimate the survival rate of individuals in a population.

Sighting data, especially when paired with the recognition of individual animals through photo ID, can be extremely powerful for studies of population, status and changes.

The goal is not only to reach a higher accuracy in terms of classification but also to understand how and why the models are classifying the species and what features are they looking into.

The data (62.8 gb) contains images of over 15,000 unique individual marine mammals from 30 different species collected from 28 different research organizations. Individuals have been manually identified and given an individual_id by marine researches.
